# Node API Template

A project template for Node web APIs focused on separation of concerns and scalability.

## Quick start

1. Clone the repository with `https://github.com/joselimaneto/node-api-template.git`
2. Setup the database on `config/database.js` (there's an example file there to be used with MySQL 😉 )
3. Install the dependencies with `yarn` (click here if [you don't have Yarn installed](https://yarnpkg.com/docs/install))
4. Create the development and test databases you have setup on `config/database.js`
5. Run the database migrations with `npm run sequelize db:migrate`
6. Add some seed data to the development database with `npm run sequelize db:seed:all`
7. Run the application in development mode with `npm run dev`
8. Access `http://localhost:3000/api/users` and you're ready to go!

## Aditional info:

- Don't forget to run the migrations for the test environment as well (including when you create a new migration) with `npm run sequelize db:migrate -- --env=test`

## Scripts

This template comes with a collection of npm scripts to make your life easier, you'll run them with `npm run <script name>` or `yarn run <script name>`:

- `dev`: Run the application in development mode
- `start` Run the application in production mode (prefer not to do that in development)
- `test`: Run the test suite
- `test:unit`: Run only the unit tests
- `test:features`: Run only the features tests
- `coverage`: Run only the unit tests and generate code coverage for them, the output will be on `coverage` folder
- `lint`: Lint the codebase
- `sequelize`: Alias to the [Sequelize CLI](https://github.com/sequelize/cli)
- `console`: Open the built-in console, you can access the DI container through the `container` variable once it's open, the console is promise-friendly.
